Last month, while scrolling through my list of starred repositories, I came across one from [fersilva](https://twitter.com/fersilvaa16) that caught my attention. It was a [presentation on Lean 4](https://github.com/fersilva16/natural-numbers-from-scratch-talk). As I explored its source code, I recalled [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck), a tool that generates presentations from Markdown JSX files. These presentations can be deployed as static websites, making them easily hostable on any platform.

The following day, I delved into the mdx-deck source code, to understand its workings and structure. This is a habit I'm trying to cultivate. It sparked a desire in me to create my own version of mdx-deck using [Astro](astro.build/).

Over the next few weeks, I dedicated a portion of my free time to figuring out how I could bring this idea to life. I opened several issues and brainstormed ideas, transforming each aspect of the project into a question that I'm trying to answer. I'm documenting everything within a main issue to keep track of progress.

Most of the issues are still open, there's a long way ahead, maybe some questions turn up becoming blog posts in the future, like:

- [publishing a package to npm](https://github.com/ddanielsantos/astro-deck/issues/9)
- [handling transitions between pages](https://github.com/ddanielsantos/astro-deck/issues/18)

I still don't know how long it will take for the project to arrive in a usable version, for now I'm enjoying the process and all the lessons that come along the way.

The project is open source, so feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/ddanielsantos/astro-deck/) and contribute.

I'll be posting some small updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/renat0sp) as well.
