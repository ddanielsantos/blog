the process of getting bigger, so the system can perform more tasks.

it can be done in two ways:

## vertically

when the machine who runs the programs gets buffed, more RAM, more CPU, more whatever, it still being the same amount of machines, but they're stronger.

## horizontally

when more machines are added to the cluster, it's like hiring more cooks to a restaurant.
