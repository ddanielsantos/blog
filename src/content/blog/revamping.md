I wasn't liking the feeling of the previous state of this blog, I wasn't liking NextJS too much, I all I need here is some static pages and Markdown support, after a quick search I found Astro, which I think has all I need.

[This is the PR where everything happened](https://github.com/ddanielsantos/portfolio/commit/bcd34ff4db0bd8a030db72e2822f26c0beafd9b2)

Astro has built-in support for Markdown, so I can simply copy my notes from Obsidian and paste them here, no extra configuration is needed. Another thing that impressed me was the [automatic integration setup](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/#automatic-integration-setup), I just specify what I want to use and Astro does the rest.

Despite the framework and some UI changes, the blog is the same, and my biggest problem is not writing posts on a regular basis, which I hope to fix soon. To accomplish this, I'm going to write some posts in the [TIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/) format, they're short, and have a lower barrier to write, writting more will help me to improve my writting quality.
