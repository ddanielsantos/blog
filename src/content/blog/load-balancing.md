When your traffic grows, it's common to take the [horizontal scaling](https://www.ddaniel.me/blog/scaling#horizontally) strategy, but with many servers running your business, how to distribute the incoming load? that's when load balancers come in handy.

A load balancer it's a piece of the system design that's responsible for directing tasks between computational resources, just like the image below:

The new load will first hit the load balancer, which will choose a processing unit to forward it, many different algorithms can be used by a load balancer to determine which processing unit will receive the next load, these are the most common algorithms:

- round robin
- weighted round robin
- least connections
- resourced based
